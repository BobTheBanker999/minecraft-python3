# Documentation

> I wanted to write some documentation for this, so here it is!

## First, my favorite part: the world gen.

In `world.py`, `start_wgen()` makes some dirt and grass blocks at a random elevation. Then, `world()` takes the y position of the first grass block and generates another grass block at `pos_list[i+1]`. The `pos_list` list is generated by `noise.py`. It is supposed to resemble Perlin noise. Here is `noise.py`:

```python3
import random

def generate(min:int, max:int, length:int):

    retval = []

    # actually generate a list of values
    last_val = random.randint(min, max)
    retval.append(last_val)

    for i in range(length):
        new_val = random.randint(last_val-1, last_val+1)
        retval.append(new_val)
        last_val = new_val

    return retval
```

First, an empty list `retval` is created. Then, a random value is generated...

nvm u prob know how it works according to the code.

bye.

also f^^k documentation so bye!
